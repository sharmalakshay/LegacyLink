# LegacyLink

LegacyLink is a platform that allows users to store final messages for their loved ones in case of an uncertain demise. It provides a secure and private way to ensure that these messages are delivered as intended.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Users can create an account and store a list of people along with personalized messages. The data is securely stored and accessible only with a password.
  
- **Private Profiles**: Each user has a private profile with a unique password, ensuring that their messages are kept confidential and accessible only to trusted individuals.

- **Password Recovery**: In the event of a user's passing without sharing their password, a request can be made to remove the password from their profile. This process is carefully verified to ensure authenticity.

## How It Works

1. **Create an Account**: Users sign up for an account on the LegacyLink platform.
   
2. **Add Recipients**: Users can add individuals to their list along with personalized messages.
   
3. **Secure Storage**: Messages are securely stored in private profiles accessible only with a password.
   
4. **Password Management**: Users are responsible for managing and safeguarding their profile password. They can choose to share it with trusted individuals or store it in a safe place.

5. **Password Recovery**: In the event of the user's passing, a trusted individual or family member can request the removal of the password from their profile. This request undergoes thorough verification to ensure authenticity before access is granted.
